# Nand2Tetris
This repo contains the completed project files for the [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org) Computer Organization course.

The work completed in each project is listed as follows:
1. [Project 1](https://github.com/MellowYarker/Nand2Tetris/tree/master/01): Created 15 elementary logic gates in the Nand2Tetris hardware description language.
2. [Project 2](https://github.com/MellowYarker/Nand2Tetris/tree/master/02): Built several chips to perform arithmetic, leading up to an ALU.
3. [Project 3](https://github.com/MellowYarker/Nand2Tetris/tree/master/03): Used a DFF to make registers and RAM units, giving the computer the ability to maintain states.
4. [Project 4](https://github.com/MellowYarker/Nand2Tetris/tree/master/04): Wrote and optimized some simple Assembly programs.
5. [Project 5](https://github.com/MellowYarker/Nand2Tetris/tree/master/05): Completed the hardware architecture by building and connecting the CPU and computer memory.
6. [Project 6](https://github.com/MellowYarker/Nand2Tetris/tree/master/06): Wrote an assembler to translate the Nand2Tetris symbolic machine code (Assembly) into 16-bit binary instructions for the CPU.

This is the first half of the Nand2Tetris series, which focuses on the hardware platform. When run in the Nand2Tetris Hardware Simulator, the code in these projects functions as a programmable 16-bit general-purpose computer. It can also read keyboard input and display output on a screen, so you can play games like Pong!

If you want to run any of these programs, you need to download the Nand2Tetris [Software Suite](https://www.nand2tetris.org/software), then replace the directories under `nand2tetris/projects` with the directories in this repo.
